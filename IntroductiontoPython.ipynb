        "# BASICS OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING \n",
        "**FEATURES OF PYTHON**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple : Python is a simple and small language.  Python is an open source project, supported by many individuals.  It is a platform independent, scripted language with complete access to operating system APIs.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This allows the users to integrate application seamlessly to create high powered feature, highly focussed applications.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Easy to Learn**  The structure of the program is very simple.  It uses few keywords and a clearly defined syntax. \n",
        "\n",
        "**High level language** Programmers do not have to worry about the low-level details like managing memory used by the program.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Interactive**  Python programs work in interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of pieces of code.   Programmers can easily interact with the interpreter directly at the Python prompt to write their programs.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Portable** Python is portable language and hence the programs behave the same in a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interference on all platforms. The programs works on any of the following operating systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390 z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC Vxworks, Playstation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE, even Pocket PC without requiring any changes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Object Oriented** : Python supports object oriented as well as procedural oriented style of programming.  While object oriented technique encapsulates data and functionalities within objects,  procedure oriente techniques, on the other hand, builds the program around procedures or functions, which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpreted** Python the interpreter not only translates the code into machine language but also executes it.  \n",
        "The interpreter takes a source program as its input and gives the output.  This is in contrast with the compiler, which produces an object file as the output of the compilation process.  Usually, a compiled program executes faster than an interpreted program.  \n",
        "\n",
        "some of the interpreted languages are Ruby, Python and PHP.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dynamic** Python executes dynamically.  Programs written in Python can be copied and used for flexible development of applications.  If there is any error, it is reported at run-time to allow interactive program development.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensive** Since python is an open source software anyone can add low level modules to the Python interpreter.  These modules enable programmers to add or to customize their tools to work more efficiently.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Embeddable** Programmers can embed Python within their C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA and Java Programs to give 'scripting' capabilities for users.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensive Libraries** Python has a huge library that is easily portable across different platforms. These library functions are compactible on UNIX, Windows, Macintosh and allows programmers to perform a wide range of applications varying from text processing, maintaining databases to GUI programming.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Secure** The python language environment is secure from tampering.  Modules can be distributed to prevent altering the code.  Apart from this, additional security checks can be easily added to implement additional security features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Robust** Python programmers cannot manipulate memory directly.  Errors are raised as exceptions that can be catch and handled by the program code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Multi-threaded : Python supports multi threading that is executing more than one process of a program simultaneously.  It also allows programmers to perform process management tasks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Garbage Collection** The Python run time environment handles garbage collections of all Python objects.  For that a reference counter is maintained to assure that no object that is currently in use is deleted.  An object that is no longer used or has gone out of scope are eligible for garbage collection.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitation** parallel processing can be done in Python, but not as elegantly as done in some other languages such as JavaScript and Go Language.  \n",
        "Python not a choice of preference for developing high graphic 3d games as it takes a lot of cpu. \n",
        "\n",
        "It lacks true multiprocessor support. It has very limited commercial support point.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Python is slower than c and c++ when computing heavy tasks and desktop application.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**APPLICATIONS OF PYTHON** \n",
        "*   Embedded Scripting Lanugage :  Python is used as a embedded scripting language for various testing / building deployment/ monitoring framework scientific app, and quick scripts. \n",
        "*   3D software : 3D software like Maya uses Python for automating small user tasks, or for doing more complex integration such as talking to databases and asset management systems.  \n",
        "*   Web Development :  Python is extensible language that provides good integration with database and other web standards.  Odoo, a consolidated suite for business application and Google App engine are other popular web application  based on python. \n",
        "*   For web development :- Python has frameworks such as Django and Pyramid, Microlevel frameworks such as Flask and Bottle, and advanced content management system such as Plone and django CMS. \n",
        "\n",
        "*   These frameworks provide libraries and modules which simplifies content management, interaction with database, and interfacing with different internet protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, FTP AND POP. \n",
        "*   **GUI based desktop application** Python has various GUI toolkits like wx python, PyQt or PyGtk which help developer highly functional GUI including.  \n",
        "Image processing and Graphic Design applications.  2D imaging software such as Inkscape, GIMP, Paint Shop Pro and Scribus. \n",
        "*   **Scientific and Computational applications** Tools such as Numeric Python and Scientific Python, 3D Modelling software such as FreeCAD.  Finite method element software like Abaqus \n",
        "*   SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science and engineering.\n",
        "Pandas is a data analysis and modelling library.\n",
        "IPython is a powerful interactive shell that supports ease of editing and recording a work session.  \n",
